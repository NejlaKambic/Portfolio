# Overview

I started delving deeper into data analysis only recently, therefore some projects can definitely be optimised and done more elegantly. Nonetheless, here are some projects which I enjoyed:

### [Temperature history - world cities](https://github.com/NejlaKambic/Portfolio/blob/main/Temperature%20history%20-%20world%20cities.ipynb)
This project assesses the yearly temperature average measured in 1000 cities across the world. The data is sourced from a Copernicus dataset, where years range from 1980 to 2020 and the 2020 data only reaches September. 

**Goals:** Primarily we want to see how the temperature of the cities changed from 1980 to now. We firstly do this by calculating the difference between the average yeary temperatures of 1980 and 2019. This serves as an indicator of the changing climate. We plot this difference on a world map.
Then the data is split into continents. Lastly we collect the cities with the biggest and smallest change in temperature for each continent.

### [Temperature history - Ljubljana, linear regression](https://github.com/NejlaKambic/Portfolio/blob/main/Temp_history_LJ-Public.ipynb)

This project assesses the yearly temperature average measured in Ljubljana, Slovenia, thus delving deeper into the dataset used for the first project. The data is sourced from a Copernicus dataset that includes daily average temperatures of 1000 cities from around the world.  We apply a linear regression model to test our hypothesis and answer the question if Ljubljana's temperature is changing significantly.
